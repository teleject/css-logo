CSS Logo for the Community
========================

Inspired by the [JS community's logo](https://github.com/voodootikigod/logo.js) and [W3C CSS buttons](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Buttons/Overview.en.html), offered here are the CSS logos. 

"If you like it, use it. If you don't, that's cool, too." 

Just don't complain about it unless you submit your own alternative to Twitter with the tag #csslogo. I am releasing this under a MIT license so you can print it on anything, use it anywhere, and never have to worry about royalties, licenses, and other such things.

Excelsior!
